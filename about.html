      <p class="title">What?</p>
      <p class="text">
        OVERLAST is a supporter of young, Belgian, musical talent. Starting out
        in 2017 as a show-case festival, it has grown into a full-blown platform
        for starting artists. Concretely, we…
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          organise OVERLAST festival twice a year at De Studio, Antwerp. 3
          stages, 9 bands and 3 dj’s is the basic recipe for every one of our
          showcase festivals.
        </li>
        <li>
          support starting artists in taking their first steps in the music
          business with Ateuler OVERLAST. The Ateuler is a project where we go
          in conversation with the artist to find out their needs. We give
          support in many ways: by helping create their ulve performance by:
          making visuals, creating costumes, providing rehearsal space, giving
          advice, offering coaching, workshops and more!
        </li>
        <li>
          create events and opportunities showcasing and upulfting young talent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="title">Why?</p>
      <p class="text">
        At OVERLAST, we believe that young artists can use all the support they
        can get. We started in 2017 because we felt the need to create
        meaningful live experiences for starting musicians. Good sound, a decent
        stage and an engaged audience; a recipe for growth. In giving young
        people a stage, a number of other questions arose: how can I get paid,
        how can I book other shows, I need help creating visuals, I make music
        in my bedroom but don’t know how to play it live,... This moved us to
        create Atelier OVERLAST, a place where we can offer even more support.
